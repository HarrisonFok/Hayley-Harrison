This is a website I made for my girlfriend and I to record our memories. This website was done with MVC, and it includes functions such as user authentication, registering, blogging, posting pictures, and adding comments to each picture.

Technology used: Node.js, MongoDB

Dependencies:
1) Run mongo demon
2) Run mongo server
3) Start the app by "node app.js"
